	3. create security group
	4. create coute tables
		
    Build the monitoring environment (ELK/prometheus/grafana)
    	1. create 2 EC2 for this porpuse (t3.medium, t2.micco)
	2. install docker, promeheus, grafana, ELK
	3. install grafana dashboard and datasource config
	4. attach consul agent as prometheus discovery source
	5. install ELK(es,logstash,kibana) -kibana should be reachable from web.
    Build a docker image of my_dummy_exported  used in the metrics session.
    	1. create docker file
	2. create docker image and push to docker hub
    Start two One EC2 instances for the application
    	1. create 2 EC2 (t2.micro)
	2. install docker
	3. run my_dummy_exporter docker
	4. install consul agaent
	5. attach consul agent to dummy exporter
    On each EC2 instance start a docker with the application
    The application needs to register to consul
    	1. create 3 EC2 (t2.micro)
	2. install consul server on each of them
    Prometheus collector will find the application in consul and monitor it.
