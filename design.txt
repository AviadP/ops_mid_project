For the mid project we would like you to complete the following
    Create VPC
    Build the monitoring environment (ELK/prometheus/grafana)
    Build a docker image of my_dummy_exported  used in the metrics session.
    Start two One EC2 instances for the application
    On each EC2 instance start a docker with the application
    The application needs to register to consul 
    Prometheus collector will find the application in consul and monitor it.
